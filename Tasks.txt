1. Trying to use context/activity types in SharedPreferencesStorage. Not working. Need to find out how
   to work with SharedPreferences type outside of an Activity or where Context is not available. Tried using getApplicationContext
   and passing Activity object. But both didnt work. For now storage functionality is scattered in the caller classes.
   2. Validation on the activity view
   4. Helper methods to get/set ui
   5. Missed call functionality
